# The CyberPatriot National Competition: What it is and how it works

The CyberPatriot National Competition is an annual event that challenges high school and middle school students to defend a network against cyber threats. The competition is run by the Air Force Association (AFA) and sponsored by the Northrop Grumman Foundation.

## What is the CyberPatriot National Competition?

The CyberPatriot National Competition is a cyber defense competition that simulates a real-world environment where teams of students have to defend a network against cyber threats. The competition is divided into three divisions: the Open Division, the All Service Division, and the Middle School Division. Teams from across the United States compete in each division, with the top teams advancing to the National Finals Competition.

The competition is designed to be challenging, but also educational and fun. Teams are given a set of virtual machines that represent a network, and they have to find and fix vulnerabilities and defend against cyber threats. The teams are judged on their technical skills, as well as their ability to work together and communicate effectively.

## How does the CyberPatriot National Competition work?

The CyberPatriot National Competition is a multi-round competition, with each round getting progressively more difficult. The competition begins with the Online Qualification Round, where teams compete against each other in their respective divisions. The top teams from each division advance to the Regional Rounds, where they compete against teams from their region.

The top teams from the Regional Rounds advance to the National Semifinal Round, where they compete against the best teams from across the country. The top teams from the National Semifinal Round advance to the National Finals Competition, where they compete for the title of National Champion.
